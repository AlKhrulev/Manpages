# NAME

A custom man page for **git**

# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION

A collection of useful git commands

# COMMON OPTIONS

# REVISION TYPES

https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions

# Conflicts

## Markers

Conflict Markers
:    `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`

Changes made in the current branch
:   between `<<<<<<<` HEAD and `=======`

Changes from the incoming branch
:   between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` incoming_branch.

Common ancestor for both commits(displayed only in `diff3` style)
:   between `|||||||` and `>>>>>>>`(i.e. current and incoming branches)

## Examples

### **Merge** style

Supports only 2 file diff, so that's what shown

```{bash}
<<<<<<< HEAD
THIS IS USEFUL
=======
This is really useful
>>>>>>> c2392943.....
```

### **Diff3** style*(supports 3-file diffs)

```{bash}
<<<<<<< HEAD
THIS IS USEFUL
||||||| merged common ancestors
This is useful
=======
This is really useful
>>>>>>> c2392943.....
```

## Process

For each conflicting file, the makers will be added automatically. Then

1. Decide which changes to keep, modify, or discard.
2. Remove all conflict markers from the file
3. Run **git add *Filename***
4. Commit the changes

# Terminal Command Examples

## Working with Commits

`git add -i`
: enable interactive mode. See `man git-add`->`INTERACTIVE MODE` for more info

`git add --patch`
:   essentially a shortcut to `git add -i`->`patch`

git commit -\-squash *COMMIT*
:   indicate that you want to squash a commit for `rebase --autosquash`. Use commit, but meld into previous commit. I.e. in this case both commit messages are combined ('melded'), one after the other, and offered to the user's editor, so that they can be amalgamated/fused together as desired by the user.

git commit -\-fixit *COMMIT*
:   indicate that you want to squash a commit for `rebase --autosquash`. Like "squash", but discard this commit's log message(in favour of *COMMIT* one's). I.e. the original commit message is kept, unchanged, and any text within the fixup commit message is ignored (unceremoniously dumped).

`git commit --amend [--no-edit]`
:   Add files to the previous commit and optionally keep the same msg

## Modifying Commit History

### Rebase vs Interactive Rebase

Taken from [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49626717/what-is-the-difference-between-interactive-rebase-and-normal-rebase)

**Rebase**
:   Does not take any user input so it picks all the commit from the branch without any amendment and applies all of it.

**Interactive Rebase**
:   It opens the editor in front of you so that we can do any kind of amendment for each commits in whatever way we want. Example:

```{bash}

pick <commit_hash> <commit_message>
pick 42522f0 add stack implementation

# Rebase 6aa416b..42522f0 onto 6aa416b (1 command)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
```

### Commands

`git rebase ... --autosquash`
:   Take advantage of *squash* or *fixit* commits done before for autosquashing

git rebase \[-i] *BranchName*
:   Apply all commits from the current branch onto *BranchName*. When you rebase a branch, you are essentially replaying all the commits of the branch onto another base commit or branch.(ex. **git checkout feature-branch && git rebase main**)

git rebase \[-i] *CommitRange*
:   Rebase a range of commits(ex. **git rebase -i HEAD~5**)

git rebase \[-i] *BaseCommitSHA*
:   Rebase all commits **after**  *BaseCommit* up to the current HEAD

git rebase ... --\exec "*COMMAND*"
:   execute command after each line that created a commit in final history. If *COMMAND* fails, rebase fails as well. Useful to test intermediate commits(ex. **--exec "make build && make run"** to check if everything builds correctly)

git (add|rm) *FileWithConflict*...
:   Mark conflicts as resolved(edit Conflict markers in *FileWithConflict* first)

`git rebase --continue`
:   Use after fixing the conflict to continue the process

`git rebase --abort`
:   Terminate rebase and return to the state before it has started

`git push --force`
:   Push updated history to remote

## Displaying Files and Differences

### Viewing Commit Logs

`git log (--name-only|--name-status) ...`
:   don't list file changes in detail and only specify their names

`git log (--name-only|--name-status) --oneline ...`
:   Same as above but print only 1 line of commit message and not the whole thing

### Viewing Files

`git show` \[\[*Rev*]:\[*Object*]...]
:   Show the state of repo(or specific objects) at a particular *Rev*(**HEAD** by default). Uses a pager by default but can be redirected into a file. Ex. **git show HEAD:LICENSE HEAD^1:README.md > file**

`git diff` \[*Rev1*]:\[*Object1*] \[*Rev2*]:\[*Object2*]
:   Ex. compare 2 files **git diff HEAD^1:README.md HEAD:README.md** or two branches **git diff develop main**

`git diff (-w|--ignore-all-space) ...`
:   Ignore whitespaces both at EOL and inside of the text

`git diff --ignore-space-at-eol ...`
:   Ignore only EOL space diffs(i.e. trailing spaces)

## Working with Remotes

git remote add *Name* *URL*.git
:   add a new remote with a name. Ex. **git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git**

git remote set-url *ExistingName* *URL*.git
:   Update remote's url

`git remote -v`
:   List all remotes

git remote rename *ExistingName* *NewName*

git remote (rm|show) *ExistingName*

git fetch \[*Remote*]/git push \[*Remote*] \[*Branch*]
:   Git implicitly inserts the remote info into your commands. Ex. **git fetch \[origin]**/**git push \[origin] \[current_branch]**

### Delete Local Branch

git branch -d *LocalBranchName*...
:   Delete fully merged branches(fails otherwise)

git branch -D *LocalBranchName* ...
:   Alias to `git branch -d --force`.
That is, delete a branch without checking that it has been merged

### Delete Remote Branch

git push -d *RemoteName* *RemoteBranchName*
:   Delete a remote branch. *RemoteName* is typically **origin**

git push *RemoteName* :*RemoteBranchName*
:   Delete a remote branch. Note there's a
space in-between *RemoteName* and a colon. Ex. **git push origin :serverfix**

`git fetch --all --prune`
:   Fetch the data from all remotes(**-\-all**) and automatically remove remote branches that donâ€™t have a local counterpart. I.e. you will first need to manually remove local branches as well before pruning remotes on your machine.

git apply ... *PatchFile*
:   Apply a *PatchFile* to the current repo

git apply ... \[-\-include="*FilePattern*"] \[-\-exclude="*FilePattern*"] *PatchFile*
:   apply hunks only to specific files based on the include/exclude filename patterns

`filterdiff ...`
:   External command that let's you specific hunks for a patchfile
